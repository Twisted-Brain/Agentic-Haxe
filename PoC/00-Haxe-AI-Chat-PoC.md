# Proof of Concept: Haxe AI Chat Application

## ::GOAL
The primary goal of this Proof of Concept (PoC) is to build a functional AI-powered chat application entirely with Haxe. This project will demonstrate Haxe's capability to handle both frontend and backend development for a modern web application.

## ::SCOPE
The application can be implemented in one of two ways, with different approaches to API key management:

1.  **100% Web App:** A single-page application (SPA) where the entire logic is handled client-side. In this model, the user provides their OpenRouter API key directly in the application's UI at runtime.
2.  **Web App with Backend:** A solution composed of a Haxe-based web frontend and a Haxe-based backend server. The backend acts as a secure gateway, using an API key stored in a server-side environment variable (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

## ::REQUIREMENTS
- The application must be built using the Haxe programming language.
- It must integrate with the OpenRouter LLM gateway.
- **API Key Handling:**
    - For the **Web App with Backend** model, the backend server must retrieve the OpenRouter API key from the system's environment variable: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
    - For the **100% Web App** model, the application must provide a mechanism for the user to input their API key at runtime. The key **must not** be stored in the project's source code or any other files within the repository.

## ::ARCHITECTURE
The project will follow the Hexagonal Architecture pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns and high code reusability.

- **Shared Core Logic (`/domain`):** All platform-agnostic business logic, data models, and interfaces will reside in the `domain` directory. This code will be shared across all target platforms.
- **Platform-Specific Implementations (`/platform`):** This directory contains all platform-specific code, strictly organized into subdirectories for each target language. No source code files are allowed directly within the `platform`, `platform/core`, or `platform/frontend` directories.
    - **Backend (`/platform/core`):** Contains server-side implementations. All Haxe code for a specific backend target (e.g., JS, C#, PHP) **must** be placed in a corresponding subdirectory (e.g., `platform/core/js`, `platform/core/csharp`).
    - **Frontend (`/platform/frontend`):** Contains the client-side web application implementations. All Haxe source files, HTML, CSS, and other assets for a specific frontend target **must** be placed in a corresponding subdirectory (e.g., `platform/frontend/js`). The primary target for the web app is a React JS application compiled from Haxe.
- **Technology Stack:** The entire application will be coded in Haxe. External libraries can be used, either from Haxelib or specific to the target platform (e.g., npm packages for the React frontend).

## App Design
**Single Page Application (SPA)** â†’ A React-based web application where all views and components reside within the app itself, with client-side navigation handling all routing.

**Bundled Application with Embedded Assets** â†’ During build time, all resources (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc.) are compiled into a single set of static files (index.html + bundle.js + assets/).

**Online Only** â†’ No service worker, no offline cache â€“ the application loads all content from the web server each time, but feels like a "native" app in the browser because it doesn't reload between pages.

ðŸ‘‰ **Summary:** A React Single Page Application (SPA) with embedded assets that runs fully online without offline caching capabilities.
